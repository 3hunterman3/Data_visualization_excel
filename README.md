# Challenge_1

Overview of project: 
  The goal of this was to be able to utalize various tools in excel to analyse data in this file. Using this data I needed to create pivot tables and pivot charts for easier visual understanding of the information given. Using this file I needed to demonstrate skills in using excels VBA program and using excels charts to allow the viewer to understand the data points from a glance. 

Analysis and Challenges: 
  The way I performed analysis on this data set was by seperating data points I found needed more clarification and data points that I thought needed to be looked more deeply into. When facing challenges in formating and using the correct code to get the results I wanted I went onto google and looked into the formating of the code and for the physical formating I watched youtube videos. I created new sheets on the data points I wanted to link together and the sheets I created were:

Category statistics: 
  This was utilized to see the outcomes of the projects based on their success, failure, canceled, or live. We can also filter this data with the countries it worked in.

Outcomes Based on Launch Date: 
  This shows how we can filter the categories in this data set and the years they were made to see if the months impact the projects in any way.

Theater Outcomes by Launch Date: 
  This allows us to see the data for theater and what month we should create a company.

Outcomes Based on Goals: 
  Using conditions that I have set I created various percentages that calculated whether certain conditions create higher successful results.

Edinburgh Research: 
  This shows how we can extract certain parts of our data using the edinburgh method on excel

Subcategory Statistics: 
  This shows the results of the subcategories in our data set and shows whether it was successful or not.

What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
- The conclusion I drew was that we should create the company in december to be able to have everything up and running by january as the success margin goes up until may and we would like to maximise our profits and goals. 

What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- The goals we have for less than 1000 to the goals to 10000 to 14999 and from goals 35000 to 39999 until 40000 to 45999 have the best success margins and we should try to set goals in that range. 

What are some limitations of this dataset?
- The limitations of this data set were the huge amount of categories I would have liked data points that were more align with another. This means it would have been more accurate if we looked at data for example if it was food every data point that relates to food and not food and theater. 

What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- the other tables or graphs we could create are if goals were reached depening on their launch date and deadlines. This can help us see success margins and see if we should see if certain categories need more setup time or if certain categories need less time to maximise our time.
